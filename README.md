# EV Charging Optimizer

âš¡ Save Money. Help the Grid. Charge Smart.

This project was created for a Hult University hackathon to make EV charging smarter and more affordable.

ðŸš€ How It Works
Tell us your daily routine.
Weâ€™ll calculate the best charging times based on low-demand hours and cheaper rates.
Get a clear estimate of how much money youâ€™ll save.
ðŸ’¡ Why It Matters
Stop overpaying for charging! Optimize your schedule, cut costs, and reduce strain on the grid. Smarter charging = bigger savings.
